HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:The patient is a 55-year-old Hispanic male who was seen initially in the 
History:
office on May 24, 2017 with epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, and bloating.
The patient at that time stated that he had established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. Since the last visit the patient 
was asked to sign a lease of information form and we sent request for information from the doctor the patient saw 
before, Dr. Stone in Las Cruces and his primary care physician in Silver City. Unfortunately we did not get any 
information from anybody. Also the patient had admission in Gila Medical Center with epigastric pain, diarrhea, 
and confusion. He spent 3 days in the hospital. He was followed by Dr. Stone and unfortunately we also do not 
have the information of what was wrong with the patient. From the patient report he was diagnosed with some 
kind of viral infection. At the time of admission he had a lot of epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills.

Reason: 
This is a 55-year-old Hispanic male who comes today for routine follow-up. He has no acute complaints. He has continued to take 
lactulose and avoid heavy doses of protein. He reports that he has a muscle sprain on his upper back from lifting. He complains of 
increasing weakness and intermittent confusion, and is eating poorly. Review of his case with the transplant center was done three 
months ago after treatment for the Hep C virus was started. He was started on Harvoni (Ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir).

Plan: 
The patient has responded well to treatment of his Hepatitis C, but his liver is rapidly deteriorating due to the chronic 
cirrhosis. He has been approved as a transplant candidate. Now that he has been on Harvoni for 60 days, I have repeated his 
test for HCV Viral Load (<1) , with remains undetectable. With the further decompensation of his liver, I will follow up 
with the transplant center for consultation and adjustment of his medications and to establish a new monitoring program. I 
would propose that we stop the Harvoni and continue monthly viral load measurements. He continues be a good candidate, 
and I will continue to follow him closely until he has a donor.

Assessment: The patient is a 55-year-old with established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, unknown cause.
HCV Antibody test was positive at today's visit. 
Plan: 1. Epigastric pain. The patient had chronic pain syndrome.
In the office twice the patient did not have any abdominal pain on physical exam.
His pain does not sound like obstruction of common bile duct and he had these episodes of abdominal pain almost 
continuously.
2. Chronic liver disease.
We need to find out the cause of the liver cirrhosis. 
We do not have any information of any type of investigation in the past.
Patient was seen by gastroenterologist already in Las Cruces, Dr. EV Easley.
The patient was advised to contact Dr. Easley by himself to convince him to send available information because we already 
send release information form signed by the patient without any result.
It will be not reasonable to repeat unnecessary tests in that point in time.
3. History of Portal Hypertension.
We are waiting for the hepatitis panel and alpha-fetoprotein level.
We will also need to get information about ultrasound which was done in Gila Medical Center, but obviously no tumor was 
found on this exam of the liver.
Today, we will administer vaccinations against hepatitis A and B. My differential diagnosis probably is hepatitis C. The 
patient denied any excessive alcohol intake, but I could not preclude alcohol-related liver cirrhosis also. We will need to 
look for nuclear antibody if it is not done before. Rule out PSC, extremely unlikely but possible.
Wilson disease also possible diagnosis but again, we first have to figure out if these tests were done for the patient or not. 
Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency will be extremely unlikely because the patient has no lung problem. On his end-stage liver

disease we already know that he had low platelet count splenomegaly. We know that his bilirubin is elevated and albumin is 
very low. I suspect that at the time of admission to the hospital the patient presented with hepatic encephalopathy. We do 
not know if INR was checked to look for coagulopathy. 
At this point in time, I recommended the patient take lactulose 50 mL 3 times daily and Inderal 10 mg twice daily. The 
patient tolerated it well; no diarrhea. We will gradually increase his dose until his heart rate will drop to 25% from 75% to 
probably 60-58.
The patient was educated how to use his medications.
Again, the patient and his wife were advised to contact all offices they have seen before to get information about what tests 
were already done and if on the next visit in 2 weeks we still do not have any information we will need to repeat all these 
tests I mentioned above.
We also discussed nutrition issues. The patient was provided information that his protein intake is supposed to be about 25 g 
per day.
He was advised not to over-eat protein and advised not to starve. He also was advised to stay away from alcohol. His next 
visit is in 2 weeks with all results available.
