REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Very difficult to get from the patient herself. She seems
to deny any significant pain or discomfort, but really seems not particularly

 on letting me know what is bothering her. She initially stated that
everything was wrong, but could not specify any specific complaints. Denies
chest pain, back pain, or abdominal pain. Denies any extremity symptoms or
complaints.
page 1 Of 3  The patient is an elderly frail looking little lady lying on the
gurney. She is awake, alert, and not really wanted to answer most of the
questions I asked her. She does have a tremor with her mouth, which the
daughter states has been there for "many page 33 years". HEENT: Eye exam is
unremarkable. Oral mucosa is still moist and well hydrated. Posterior pharynx
is clear. NECK: Supple. LUNGS: Actually clear with good breath sounds. There
are no wheezes, no rales, or rhonchi. Good air movement. CARDIAC: Without
murmur. ABDOMEN: Soft. I do not elicit any tenderness. There is no abdominal
distention. Bowel sounds are present in all quadrants. SKIN: Skin is without
rash or petechiae. There is no cyanosi page 1 OF 3

                                PLAN: At this time, I had reviewed the patient's records and it is not
particularly enlightening as to what could have triggered off this episode.
The patient herself has good vital signs. She does not seem to have any
specific acute process going on and seemed to feel comfortable after the
Ativan was given, a small quantity was given to the patient. Family and
daughter specifically did not want to pursue any workup at this point, which
at this point I think is reasonable and we will have her follow up with ABC.
She is discharged in stable condition.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 91-year-old female who was brought in by
family. Apparently, she was complaining that she felt she might have been
poisoned at her care facility. The daughter who accompanied the patient states
that she does not think anything is actually wrong, but she became extremely
agitated and she thinks that is the biggest problem with the patient right
now. The patient apparently had a little bit of dry heaves, but no actual
vomiting.
Page 1 OF 3 MATERIALS USED: 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, 5-0 Prolene, as well as two 16-mm
partially treaded cannulated screws of the OsteoMed system, one 18-mm
partially treaded cannulated screw of the OsteoMed system of the 3.0 size. One
10-mm 2.0 partially threaded cannulated screw of the OsteoMed system. PAGE 1 of 3 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating
room and placed on the operating table in the supine position. After adequate
sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic
mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's right foot to anesthetize
the future surgical sites. The right ankle was covered with cast padding and
an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the right ankle and set up at
250 mmHg.

Using sharp and dull dissection, the
periosteal and capsular tissues were mobilized from the head and neck of the
first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great
toe. The conjoint tendon was identified on the lateral plantar aspect of the
base of the proximal phalanx and resected transversely.

PAGE 1 OF 3

A lateral capsulotomy was also performed at the level of the first right
metatarsophalangeal joint. Using sharp and dull dissection, the dorsomedial
prominence of the first right metatarsal head was adequately exposed and
resected with the use of a sagittal saw.

page 5 of 13 Two wires of the OsteoMed system were also used as provisional fixation wires
and also as guidewires for the insertion of the future screws. The wires were
inserted dorsal distal to plantar proximal through the dorsal arm of the
osteotomy. 
page 5 Of 13  with its base medially and its apex
laterally. Upon removal of the base wedge from the base of the proximal
phalanx, the osteotomy was reduced with the OsteoMed smooth wire, which was
also used as a guidewire for the insertion of a 16-mm partially threaded
cannulated screw from the OsteoMed 3.0 system. Upon insertion of the screw,
using AO technique, the wire was removed. The screw was inserted proximal
medial to distal lateral through the osteotomy of the base of the proximal
phalanx of the right great toe. Fixation of the osteotomy was found to be
excellent. Reduction of the bunion deformity was

        All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped and cauterized. The
incision was deepened through the level of the periosteum over the surgical
neck of the second right metatarsal. All the tendinous and neurovascular
structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved. Using
sharp and dull dissection, the PAGE 19 surgical neck of the second right metatarsal
was adequately exposed and then Weil-type osteotomy was performed from dorsal
distal to plantar proximal through the surgical neck of the second right
metatarsal. The capital fragment was then transposed proximally and impacted
on the shaft of the second right metatarsal.

    he 2.0 Osteo-Med system was also used to fixate this osteotomy wire from that
system was inserted dorsal proximal to plantar distal through the second right
metatarsal osteotomy and the wire was used as a guidewire for the insertion of
the 10-mm partially threaded 2.0 cannulated screw.

Page 5 Of 13  Upon insertion of the
screw, using AO technique, the wire was then removed. Fixation of the
osteotomy with 2.0 screw was found to be excellent. The second right
metatarsophalangeal joint was then relocated and the dislocation of that joint
was completely reduced. Range of motion of the second right
metatarsophalangeal joint was found to be excellent. Page 5 OF 13 ions were placed directly over the bony prominence at the level of the
second right PIP joint. The island of skin between the two semi-elliptical
incisions was resected in toto. The dissection was carried down to the level
of extensor digitorum longus of the second PAGE 5 of 13 PAGE 5 Of 13 PAGE 5 OF 13  The patient was eventually discharged from Hospital according to
nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with Dr. X's office in one
week's time for her first postoperative appointment.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a pleasant 50-year-old female who has
undergone an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis. Overall, her
quality of life has significantly improved since she had her APR. She is
functioning well with her ileostomy. She did have concerns or questions about
her diet and we discussed the BRAT diet, which consisted of foods that would
slow down the digestive tract such as bananas, rice, toast, cheese, and peanut
butter.
page 15 OF 23
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 95.8, pulse 68, blood pressure 132/73,
and weight 159 pounds. This is a pleasant female in no acute distress. The
patient 's abdomen is soft, nontender, Page 15 Of 23 nondistended with a well-healed midline
scar. There is an ileostomy in the right hemiabdomen, which is pink, patent,
productive, and protuberant. There are no signs of masses or hernias over the
patient's abdomen

penetrance and quality, reveal scapholunate widening of a slack wrist with a
possible ulnar styloid nonunion, with a possible occult distal radius fracture
