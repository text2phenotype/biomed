"""
This directory `tests/experiment/working_dir/` is intended to hold any local scripts a
developer writes and/or uses that they don't want to upload to github.
The .gitignore will ignore all folders and files in this directory, making it a useful place to stash code.

It's a good place to have files that can access biomed package content from the user's preferred IDE (eg PyCharm)

NOTE: if the local copy of the repository is ever removed and replaced,
the user will lose whatever files were in this directory
